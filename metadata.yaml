description: 'One of the most popular mass-market fiction writers of the late nineteenth
  century, American author Alexander McVeigh Miller (who often used her husband''s
  name as a pen name) became well-known for her mastery of shocking plot twists. The
  two tales collected in the double feature Guy Kenmore''s Wife and The Rose and the
  Lily are chock-full of Miller''s trademark motifs: family secrets, deathbed confessions,
  mysterious letters, and intricate clues.'
